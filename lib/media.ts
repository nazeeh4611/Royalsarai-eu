 * Central image registry.

 * No stock-photo API key is available in this environment (Unsplash and
 * Pexels both require one; Unsplash's old key-free "Source" endpoint was
 * shut down in 2022). Every slot below therefore renders through
 * <MediaFrame>, which falls back to a custom abstract illustration
 * (see components/media/AbstractScene.tsx) instead of a broken <img>.
 *
 * TO SWAP IN REAL PHOTOGRAPHY LATER: fill in `src` (a local file under
 * /public or a configured remote domain) and `credit` on the relevant
 * entry below. MediaFrame automatically renders a real Next/Image once
 * `src` is present — no component changes required.
